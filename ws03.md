# What are Lifetimes?


* A lifetime is a construct the compiler (or more specifically, its *borrow checker*) uses to ensure all borrows are valid.
* While *lifetimes* and *scopes* are often referred to together, **they are not the same**.
    * Scope refers to the accessibility/visibility of a variable.
    * Lifetime refers to the duration of borrowing of a variable.

---

# Lifetimes vs. scopes

```rust
fn main() {
    let i = 3;
    {
        let borrow1 = &i;
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1);
    }
    {
        let borrow2 = &i;
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2);
    }
}
```

## Answer the following questions

* What is happening in this code?
* What is the scope of `i`?
* What is the scope of `borrow1`?
* What is the scope of `borrow2`?
* What is the lifetime of `i`?
* What is the lifetime of `borrow1`?
* What is the lifetime of `borrow2`?

---

# Lifetimes vs. scopes

```rust
fn main() {
    let i = 3; // Scope of `i` starts. // Lifetime of `i` starts.
    {
        let borrow1 = &i; // Scope of `borrow1` starts. // Lifetime of 'borrow1' starts.
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1); // Lifetime of `borrow1` ends.
    } // Scope of `borrow1` ends.
    {
        let borrow2 = &i; // Scope of `borrow2` starts. // Lifetime of `borrow2` starts.
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2); // Lifetime of `i` ends. // Lifetime of `borrow2` ends.
    } // Scope of `borrow2` ends.
    // Scope of `i` ends.
}
```

## Takeaway

* Variable scope != Lifetimes.

# Temporality of borrowing


```rust
// Fails to compile.
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           // -+       |
    }                     //          |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {}", r); // ---------+
}
```

## Answer the following questions

* What is happening in this code?
* What are the lifetimes of `r` and `x`?
* Why doesn't this code compile?
* **Which line can I delete to make this compile?**

# The cheeky fix


```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           // -+-------|
    }
    // println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

* By deleting the `println!`, the borrow checker can see that `r` is not used in its own scope again so it will shorten its lifetime to the last point `r` is used.
    * This reiterates how lifetimes != scope.
* This behaviour by the borrow checker is referred to as the "temporality" of borrowing.
* Also known as **Non Lexical Lifetimes**, which was an idea introduced in 2018.
    * The pre-2018 version of the Rust compiler would not have compiled the above code.

# The "correct" fix


```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                          //           |
    let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                          //   |       |
    println!("r: {}", r); // --+-------+
}
```

# Annotating lifetimes

* *Sometimes* when defining functions that borrow in Rust, the compiler will ask you to explicitly annotate your borrow types with lifetimes.

```rust
// Does not compile.
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Loooooong");
    let y = String::from("Short");
    let str = longest(&x, &y);
    println!("{}", str);
}
```

---

# How to annotate lifetimes in functions?

* Here is the syntax for annotating lifetimes in Rust.

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Loooooong"); // Lifetime of `x` starts.
    let y = String::from("Short"); // Lifetime of `y` starts.
    let str = longest(&x, &y); // Liftime of `str` starts.
    println!("{}", str); // Lifetime of `str` ends. Lifetime of `x` ends. Lifetiimes of `y` ends.
}
```

---

# What do the lifetimes actually mean?

* The following is equivalent in meaning to the previous slide.

```rust
// fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str
fn longest<'x, 'y, 'z>(x: &'x str, y: &'y str) -> &'z str 
where
    'x: 'z,
    'y: 'z,
{
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Loooooong"); // Lifetime of `x` starts.
    let y = String::from("Short"); // Lifetime of `y` starts.
    let str = longest(&x, &y); // Liftime of `str` starts.
    println!("{}", str); // Lifetime of `str` ends. Lifetime of `x` ends. Lifetiimes of `y` ends.
}
```

* `where` allows us to explicitly add constraints to lifetimes.
* `'x: 'z,` means lifetime of `x` must be at least as long as lifetime of `z`.
* `'y: 'z,` means lifetime of `y` must be at least as long as lifetime of `z`.

# How does the borrow checker use this information to protect us?

```rust
// Does not compile
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Loooooong"); // Lifetime of `x` starts.
    let str; // Lifetime of `str` starts.
    {
        let y = String::from("Short"); // Lifetime of `y` starts.
        str = longest(&x, &y);
    } // Lifetime of `y` ends.
    println!("{}", str); // Lifetime of `str` ends. // Lifetime of `x` ends.
}
```

## Answer these questions

* Is the lifetime of `x` at least as long as lifetime of `str`?
* Is the lifetime of `y` at least as long as lifetime of `str`?

# Another example

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = String::from("Loooooong"); // Lifetime of `x` starts.
    {
        let y = String::from("Short"); // Lifetime of `y` starts.
        let str = longest(&x, &y); // Lifetime of `str` starts.
        println!("{}", str); // Lifetime of `str` ends. Lifetime of `x` ends. Lifetime of `y` ends.
    }
}
```

## Answer these questions

* Is the lifetime of `x` at least as long as lifetime of `str`?
* Is the lifetime of `y` at least as long as lifetime of `str`?

    country_name
}

    let mut country = "Kiribati";

    country = prints_country(country);
