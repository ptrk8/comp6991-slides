# What are Lifetimes?


* A lifetime is a construct the compiler (or more specifically, its *borrow checker*) uses to ensure all borrows are valid.
* While *lifetimes* and *scopes* are often referred to together, **they are not the same**.
    * Scope refers to the accessibility/visibility of a variable.
    * Lifetime refers to the duration of borrowing of a variable.

# Lifetimes vs. scopes

```rust
fn main() {
    let i = 3;
    {
        let borrow1 = &i;
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1);
    }
    {
        let borrow2 = &i;
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2);
    }
}
```

## Answer the following questions

* What is happening in this code?
* What is the scope of `i`?
* What is the scope of `borrow1`?
* What is the scope of `borrow2`?
* What is the lifetime of `i`?
* What is the lifetime of `borrow1`? ðŸ‘€
* What is the lifetime of `borrow2`? ðŸ‘€

# Lifetimes vs. scopes

```rust
fn main() {
    let i = 3; // Scope of `i` starts. // Lifetime of `i` starts.
    {
        let borrow1 = &i; // Scope of `borrow1` starts.
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1);
        // Scope of `borrow1` ends.
    }
    {
        let borrow2 = &i; // Scope of `borrow2` starts.
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2); // Lifetime of `i` ends.
        // Scope of `borrow2` ends.
    }
    // Scope of `i` ends.
}
```

* There are no lifetimes to consider for variables `borrow1` and `borrow2` because they are never borrowed and don't need checking by the compiler (borrow checker)!
