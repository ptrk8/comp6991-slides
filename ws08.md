# Concurrency vs. Parrallelism

* Although concurrency and parallelism are often used interchangeably, they mean different things.

## Concurrency

* When multiple processes run on a single CPU core by *context switching* between processes.
* In other words, only one process can make progress at any given time.
* This is also known as "time-sharing" a CPU core.
## Parrallelism

* When multiple processes run on multiple CPU cores.
* In other words, `N` processes running on `N` different CPU cores would be able to make progress at the same time.

# Concurrency illustrated

* In this example, there are two processes `P1` and `P2` but one CPU core.
* Either `P1` or `P2` can make progress at any given time.
* The operating systems decides when to *context-switch* between `P1` and `P2`.
* This example illustrates two processes **concurrently** running.

```
~~~plantuml -utxt -pipe
@startuml

rectangle P1 as p11
rectangle P1 as p12
rectangle P2 as p21
rectangle P2 as p22
rectangle P1 as p13
rectangle P1 as p14

p11 .d..> p12
p12 .r.> p21
p21 .d..> p22
p22 .l.> p13
p13 .d..> p14

# Parrallelism illustrated

* In this example, there are four processes `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4` and four CPU cores.
* All four processes are running at the exact same time in **parallel**.

```
~~~plantuml -utxt -pipe
@startuml
top to bottom direction

rectangle P1 as p11
rectangle P1 as p12
rectangle P2 as p21
rectangle P2 as p22
rectangle P3 as p31
rectangle P3 as p32
rectangle P4 as p41
rectangle P4 as p42

p11 ..d..> p12
p21 ..d..> p22
p31 ..d..> p32
p41 ..d..> p42
