# Polymorphism


## Definition

> In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages.

*Source: Wikipedia*

# Forms of polymorphism

The three main forms of polymorphism are:

## Ad hoc polymorphism

* Defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types.

## Parametric polymorphism
* Not specifying concrete types and instead use abstract symbols that can substitute for any type.

## Subtyping (subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism)

* When a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass.

# Enums

* Structs give you a way of grouping related fields and data.
* Enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values.
* Rust supports "ad hoc polymorphism" through enums.

## Example

* The following enum establishes an `IpAddrKind` custom data type.

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
/// fn main() {
/// }
```

* Now you can create concrete instances of the `IpAddrKind` type like so:

```rust
/// enum IpAddrKind {
///     V4,
///     V6,
/// }
/// fn main() {
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
/// }
```

* We can now define a function that takes any `IpAddrKind` and call it with either variant like so:

```rust
/// enum IpAddrKind {
///     V4,
///     V6,
/// }
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

fn main() {
    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
}
```

---

# More on Enums

* You can also associate different types and amounts of data to each variant of an enum like so:

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle(f64, f64),
}
/// fn main() {
/// }
```

* Just as you can define methods on structs using `impl`, you can also define methods on enums like so:

```rust
/// enum Shape {
///     Circle(f64),
///     Rectangle(f64, f64),
/// }
impl Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        match self {
            Shape::Circle(radius) => std::f64::consts::PI * radius * radius,
            Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => width * height,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Shape::Circle(1.0);
    println!("Circle Area: {}", c.area());
    let r = Shape::Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
    println!("Rectangle Area: {}", r.area());
}
```

---

# Generics

* Rust supports "parametric polymorphism" through generics.
* Generics allowing **functions** or **data types** to be written without specifying concrete types.
* Below are familiar examples of generics in data types.

## `Option<T>`

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
/// fn main() {
/// }
```

## `Result<T, E>`

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
/// fn main() {
/// }
```

---

# Motivating Generics

* Consider the following two functions that both find the largest value in a slice:

```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

## Question

* What do we observe is similar and different about `largest_i32` and `largest_char`?
* How can we create a single generic function that allows us to find the largest element in either slice?
    * Why do we want to do this?

---

# Creating a Generic Function


* To define the generic largest function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

## Question

* Are we done? Will this compile?

---

# No

* Here's the compiler error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0369]: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `&T`
 --> src/main.rs:5:17
  |
5 |         if item > largest {
  |            ---- ^ ------- &T
  |            |
  |            &T
  |
help: consider restricting type parameter `T`
  |
1 | fn largest<T: std::cmp::PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
  |             ++++++++++++++++++++++
```

## Question

* What is the compiler complaining about?

---

# Solution (Trait bounds)

* The problem is that not all types `T` are comparable with the `>` operator.
    * For example, if you create a custom `Car` type, it can be unclear how you order a vector of `Car`s.
    * Do you order by model year, manufacturing date, name, VIN number etc.?
    * If you want to order your custom type, you must implement the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparison.
* Therefore, we need to use *trait bounds* to restrict `T` to types that have implemented the `PartialOrd` trait.

```rust
fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

## Question

* What is known *statically* at compile time about how `largest` is called?
* What do you think the Rust compiler does when you compile the above code?

---

# Monomorphisation

* For our example, the Rust compiler will actually generate the following code behind the scenes:

```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

* This is called "monomorphisation" to perform "static dispatch".
    * "Dispatch" refers to the mechanism to determine which specific version of code is actually run.

## Question

* Why is this called *static* dispatch? <!-- Because all the types are known at compile time. -->
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of monomorphisation? <!-- Next slide. -->

---

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Monomorphisation to perform Static Dispatch

## Advantages

* Code executes fast at runtime.

## Disadvantages

* Compiled binary is bloated.
* Compilers aren’t perfect and may “optimise” code to become slower. <!-- For example, functions inlined too eagerly will bloat the instruction cache. -->

---

# Dynamic dispatch

* Dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation to call at runtime.
* Dynamic dispatch is necessary when its not possible to know all your types at compile time.
    * For example, consider the scenario of implementing a reusable library consumed by others.

## Example

* We define a `Draw` trait.

```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}
/// fn main() {}
```

* We define a `Screen` struct that holds a `components` vector.
    * This vector is of type `Box<dyn Draw>`, which is a *trait object*; it’s a stand-in for any type inside a Box that implements the Draw trait.

```rust
pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}
/// fn main() {}
```

* On the Screen struct, we’ll define a method named `run` that will call the `draw` method on each of its components.

```rust
impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
/// fn main() {}
```

## Question

* What are some concrete examples of `components` we might have in `Screen`?

---

# Question

* Why couldn't we have implemented the previous code with this?
<!-- This restricts us to a Screen instance that has a list of components all of type Button or all of type TextField. If you’ll only ever have homogeneous collections, using generics and trait bounds is preferable because the definitions will be monomorphized at compile time to use the concrete types. -->

```rust
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
    pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Screen<T>
where
    T: Draw,
{
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
/// fn main() {}
```

* A common use-case for dynamic dispatch is the need to call methods on a collection of different (heterogeneous) types with the same trait.

---

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Dynamic Dispatch

## Advantages

* Compiled binary is less bloated.
* Compilers unlikely to “optimise” code to become slower.

## Disadvantages

* Code executes slower at runtime.
