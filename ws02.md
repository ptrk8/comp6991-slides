# COMP6991 Workshop 2

**Contents:**

* Introducing `Vec`.
* Introducing `HashMap`.
* Simple derive macros (Copy, Clone, Debug).
* The purpose of the serde crate.

---

# What is a `Vec`?

* Short for "Vector".
* A Vector is a dynamic array.
* From the Rust docs:

> A contiguous growable array type with heap-allocated contents, written `Vec<T>`.
\
Vectors have O(1) indexing, amortized O(1) push (to the end) and O(1) pop (from the end).

# How to Initialise a `Vec`?

**Method 1:**

Explicitly create a `Vec` with `Vec::new`.

```rust
/// fn main() {
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
///}
```

**Method 2:**

Use the `vec!` macro.

```rust
/// fn main() {
let v: Vec<i32> = vec![];

let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let v = vec![0; 10]; // ten zeroes

println!("{:?}", v);
///}
```

---

# How to Push to `Vec`?

Pushing appends values onto the end of a vector (which will dynamically the vector as needed):

```rust
/// fn main() {
let mut v = vec![1, 2];

println!("{:?}", v);

v.push(3);

println!("{:?}", v);
///}
```

---

# How to Pop from `Vec`?

Popping pops a value from the **end** of a vector.

```rust
/// fn main() {
let mut v = vec![1, 2];

println!("{:?}", v);

let two = v.pop();

println!("{:?}", v);
///}
```
