# COMP6991 Workshop 2

**Contents:**

* Introducing `Vec`.
* Introducing `HashMap`.
* Simple derive macros (Copy, Clone, Debug).
* The purpose of the serde crate.

---
# What is a `Vec`?

* Short for "Vector".
* A Vector is a dynamic array.
* From the Rust docs:

> A contiguous growable array type with heap-allocated contents, written `Vec<T>`.
\
Vectors have O(1) indexing, amortized O(1) push (to the end) and O(1) pop (from the end).

---
# How to Initialise a `Vec`?

**Method 1:**

Explicitly create a `Vec` with `Vec::new`.

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```


**Method 2:**

Use the `vec!` macro.

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = vec![];

let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let v = vec![0; 10]; // ten zeroes
println!("{:?}", v);
```

A terminal based presentation tool

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Written in Go!")
}
```

---

## Everything is markdown
In fact this entire presentation is a markdown file

---

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

---

# Markdown components
You can use everything in markdown!
* Like bulleted list
* You know the deal

1. Numbered lists too

---

# Tables

| Tables | Too    |
| ------ | ------ |
| Even   | Tables |

---

# Graphs

```
digraph {
    rankdir = LR;
    a -> b;
    b -> c;
}
```
```
┌───┐     ┌───┐     ┌───┐
│ a │ ──▶ │ b │ ──▶ │ c │
└───┘     └───┘     └───┘
```
---

All you need to do is separate slides with triple dashes
`---` on a separate line, like so:

```markdown
# Slide 1
Some stuff

--- 

# Slide 2
Some other stuff
```
